<h1>Technical Writing Samples</h1>
<p> Here is a small sampling of my Technical Writing and Editing. I have provided links to PDFs of my work for your convenience.</p>
<h2>Context of Help Guide for RefWorks Commission</h2>                                                                               

<p>My team and I wrote a set of instructions for the EWU library on how to use RefWorks, an online citation tool. The EWU librarians commissioned us to write a help guide for RefWorks and distribute it because the majority of students did not know about RefWorks.</p>

<p>This help guide was handed out at a training session on how to use RefWorks we hosted for English 101 and 102 students. My team and I first wrote a proposal to the library detailing how we would solve the issue involving the lack of awareness about RefWorks.</p>

 <p>Then, we researched RefWorks and conducted a usability test to determine what information the typical user would need in order to navigate RefWorks. Finally, we wrote the instructions in MicrosoftWord and added screen shots to complement the instructions. There were no major challenges in writing the instructions and during the training session, students were clearly able to use the documents without trouble.</p>

<h2>Context of Kaiser Aluminum Job Plan Commission</h2> 
                                                           
<p>My team and I extensively redesigned a job plan for Kaiser Aluminum. A job plan is a list of instructions and equipment used to complete tasks. The job plan was written for mostly middle-aged employees working in grimy, dimly light
areas. </p>

<p>My team and I utilized Google Docs and Microsoft Word to format the document which was, originally, a PDF. We first interviewed the manager of Kaiser Aluminum and asked relevant questions about the context of the document and his expectations regarding it. Then, we went on a tour of the Kaiser Aluminum plant to evaluate the sort of environment the employees were working in and how that would affect the readability of the document.</p>

<p>The problem we encountered with the document was that it was written in all capital letters, warning and caution signs
werenâ€™t correctly formatted, and the steps were not shown as separate from other content, such as notes about equipment and warnings. For the job plan revision, my team and I fulfilled the expectations of our client. We improved the design of the document, making it more readable and, consequently, more useable.</p>
